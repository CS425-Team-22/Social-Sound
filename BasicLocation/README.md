this section of the social sound application retrieves
the precise coordinates of an android device.

for this to function, the following must be true:
1. the user must be logged in to an existing Google account
   (this is necessary to access Google Maps and display location)
    
2. the user must have already enabled permission for program to access location
    this can occur one of two ways:
        the user gives full access to devices location, any time.
        or the user allows access to the device location WHILE the program is running.
